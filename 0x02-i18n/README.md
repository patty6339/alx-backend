Here's a quick overview on each of these concepts:

1. **Parametrize Flask Templates for Multi-language Support**: Flask templates can be made dynamic by passing language-specific content as parameters, allowing different language versions of the same content to be displayed. For example, by defining translations in JSON files or using a translation library like Flask-Babel, you can customize templates to adapt to the user's language preference.

2. **Infer Locale from URL Parameters, User Settings, or Request Headers**: To offer content in a user's preferred language, it's common to detect the locale based on URL parameters (e.g., `?lang=fr`), stored user preferences, or the `Accept-Language` header from the user's browser. This way, the app can serve localized content automatically.

3. **Localize Timestamps**: Displaying timestamps in a user's local timezone enhances usability. Flask can use libraries like `Babel` or `pytz` to convert timestamps to the appropriate timezone. This also includes formatting dates and times to match the user's locale-specific conventions.
